======================================================


HKS.m:      Compute the heat kernel signature for each point in the mesh given the
            eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Laplace operator. The time axis is
            sampled logarithmically. 

HKS_t.m:    Compute the heat kernel signature restricted to a given time scale
            given the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Laplace operator.
