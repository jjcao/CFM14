% this is the callback function for ClickA3DPoint

function callbackClickA3DPoint(src,eventdata, PointCloud);

Point = get(gca,'CurrentPoint');        % get the mouse click position

CamDir = CamPos - CamTgt;               % Camera direction

% build a orthonormal frame based on the viewing direction and the up vector (the "view frame")
Z_axis = CamDir/norm(CamDir);    
UP_axis = CamUpVect/norm(CamUpVect); 
X_axis = cross(UP_axis,Z_axis);
Y_axis = cross(Z_axis, X_axis);

% --- find the nearest neighbour to the clicked point 
%
% project the 3D point cloud onto a plane (i.e. ignore the z coordinate) 
% and find the point that is the closest to the clicked point in that 2D plane.

% % older version
% diff = [ RotatedPointCloud(1,:) - RotatedPointFront(1)   ;  RotatedPointCloud(2,:) - RotatedPointFront(2) ]; % the difference of all the 2D points from the clicked point (2D)
% AllDistances = RowNorm(diff');                  % the distance of all the 2D points from the clicked point (2D)
% [dist, PointCloudIndex] = min(AllDistances);	% find the point that is closest to the clicked point (2D)

% update (June 2, 2008): this does the same thing
PointCloudIndex = dsearchn( RotatedPointCloud(1:2,:)' , RotatedPointFront(1:2) );

% ---- delete the old nearest neighbour & display the new nearest neighbour

    set(h,'Tag','pt');   % set its Tag property for later use
